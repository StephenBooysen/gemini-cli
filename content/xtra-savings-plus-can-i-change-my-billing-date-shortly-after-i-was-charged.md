# Can I change my billing date shortly after I was charged? 

Yes, you can. 

Example below:  

- Luvo's current billing date is the 21st of March.  

- Luvo updates his billing date on 22nd March.  

- Luvo's new billing date is now the 25th  

- Luvo will be billed the prorated charges on 22 March for the period 21 â€“ 24 April. I.e., 4 x R3.33 = R13.32   

- Luvo will be billed again on 25 April for R99.

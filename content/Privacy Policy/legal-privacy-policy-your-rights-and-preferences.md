# Your rights and preferences 

You have the right to know what personal information we have about you, to correct it 
and to opt out of any marketing. 
You have the right to:

- ask what personal information we hold about you; 
- ask what information was sent to our suppliers, service providers or any other third party; 
- ask us to update, correct or delete any out-of-date or incorrect personal information we hold about you, under certain conditions; 
- unsubscribe from any direct marketing communications we may send you; 
- submit a complaint to a relevant supervisory authority;
- to not be subjected to automated decision making which results in legal consequences for you or which affects you to a substantial degree;
- object to the processing of your personal information; 
- ask us to restrict the processing of your personal information, under certain conditions.

It can take us up to 21 days to respond to your request and we may charge a small fee. If you want us to 
delete all personal information we have about you, you will probably have to terminate all agreements you 
have with us. We cannot maintain our relationship with you without having some of your personal information. We can refuse to delete your information if we are required by law to keep it or if we need it to 
protect our rights.

Please contact our Compliance Officer shown at the beginning of this Privacy Statement if you want to submit 
any request to us. We will provide you with a form and the amount of any fee.

## Some of your information is available online. 
You can view and correct some of your information online by creating an online profile, via our mobile apps 
such as Sixty60 or Money Market Account, our websites or our call centres. Other information can be 
corrected on request via email to privacy@shoprite.co.za.

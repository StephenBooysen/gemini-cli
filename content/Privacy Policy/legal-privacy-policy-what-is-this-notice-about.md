# What is this notice about?

## We want you to understand who you are sharing your information with, what kind of information we collect and how we use the information. 
In your day-to-day dealings with the Shoprite Group of Companies we obtain information about you. We want you to know exactly what that information is and what we do with it. This Privacy Statement describes how we collect, use, process, and disclose your personal information, in conjunction with your access to and use of Shoprite Groupâ€™s web and app platforms. 

## POPIA protects you. 
The Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA) is aimed at protecting your personal information and prescribes what we must and must not do with it. POPIA created an Information Regulator who checks that companies like Shoprite manage personal information in a responsible manner that respects your privacy. 

## Other legislation applies to your personal information. 
As Shoprite conducts its business activities in various countries throughout Africa, the data privacy legislation
applicable in these countries also applies to our processing of your personal information. In certain respects, 
the data privacy legislation applicable in these countries may differ or provide for more extensive protections 
than POPIA. To this end, please refer to Annexure A for specific data privacy exemptions not mentioned in 
this Privacy Statement.

Furthermore, other legislation also applies to your personal information. For instance, if you are applying for 
a Shoprite Money Transfer account, the Financial Intelligence Centre Act 38 of 2001 (FICA) must be complied 
with, or if you buy a SIM card, the Regulation of Interception of Communications and Provision of 
Communication-Related Information Act 70 of 2002 (RICA) must be complied with. This means that from time 
to time we will be obligated to process your personal information in a certain way (or keep it for a certain 
period). 

## This Privacy Statement is part of our agreement with you. 
This Privacy Statement forms part of our agreement with you as a natural person or as a business. You should 
read it along with the terms and conditions that apply. These terms and conditions can be accessed on the 
specific Shoprite Group websites or products, and www.shopriteholdings.co.za. 

## This notice may change from time to time. 
From time to time, we may have to amend this notice to accommodate changes in our business or services 
or if legal requirements change. It is your responsibility to check that you have read the latest version.

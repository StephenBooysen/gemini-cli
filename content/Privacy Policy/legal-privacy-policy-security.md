# Security 

## We take your privacy and the security of your personal information seriously. 

We have implemented reasonable security safeguards to protect the personal information that you give us. 
For example, sensitive data (such as your credit card information) is protected by TLS encryption when it is 
exchanged between your web browser and our website. 
You can play a role in protecting your information by never sharing your username, PIN or password with 
anyone or submitting it to a website you dont recognise. Always log off after a web session and change your 
password regularly. 
We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks. No system is perfect so we cannot 
guarantee that information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of any of our 
physical, technical or managerial safeguards. 
Please note that any email you send to us is not encrypted and may be monitored by us. Please do not send 
us sensitive or confidential personal information by email. 

## We will inform you if your privacy is ever compromised. 
Although we cannot prevent all security threats, we have measures in place to minimise the threat to your 
privacy. Should there be a data breach where your personal information is directly affected, we will follow 
the guidelines provided by data privacy legislation in order to inform you and relevant local supervisory 
authority.

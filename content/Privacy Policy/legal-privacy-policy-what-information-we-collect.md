 ## If you apply for a job with us 
We may request personal information about your education, employment, racial background and state of 
health. As part of your application you will be asked to provide your express consent to our use of this 
information to assess your application and to allow us to carry out both recruitment analytics and any 
monitoring activities which may be required of us under applicable law as an employer. 
We may also carry out screening checks (including reference, background, directorship, financial, identity, 
eligibility to work, vocational suitability and criminal record checks) and consider you for other positions. We 
may exchange your personal information with academic institutions, recruiters, screening check providers, 
health service providers, professional and trade associations, law enforcement agencies, recruitment 
analytics providers, referees and your current and previous employers. 
We may also gather additional information about you from publicly available resources such as LinkedIn or 
other social or professional media platforms and collate this with the information that you provide to us. 
Without your personal information, we may not be able to progress considering you for positions with us. In 
some instances, personal information must be provided to us in order for us to legally or contractually 
perform services to you, for example where we are required by law to gather personal information for antimoney laundering identification purposes. Where relevant we will highlight to you those details that we are 
required to collect. 

 ## We collect information when you contact our call centres to respond to your query. 
When you contact our customer support services, we collect information that helps us to categorise your 
query, respond to it and, if applicable, investigate what went wrong. We also use this information to track 
potential problems and trends to customise our support responses to provide a better service to you. Calls 
are recorded for quality control and record-keeping purposes.

Our call centres are committed to keeping your personal information safe and secure. Please take care not 
to provide more information than what we ask for. Please do not provide your bank account details or 
passwords to our Call Centre Agents. Any unnecessary information you give us will not be retained.

# Sharing your information 

Your privacy is important to us, and we undertake not to use or share your personal information unless for 
business purposes. 
You agree that we may make your information available to the following people and organisations in order 
to process your data as set out in this Privacy Statement:

- Your data may be used by other divisions and entities in the Shoprite Group. 
- We only share your personal information with companies that help us to provide our services to you and 
who have agreed to keep your information secure and to only use it for authorised purposes. 
- With any third-party advertisers/businesses to better accommodate and run campaigns. 
- We use suppliers or service providers who we trust to provide services to us and sometimes that involves 
sharing your information with them. They operate under strict requirements aimed at keeping your 
personal information secure and confidential and they will only use it for the purpose for which we have 
sent it to them. We will engage external service providers with appropriate Non-Disclaimer and/or Data Sharing Agreements to protect your data.
- We may share your personal information with banking institutions and the issuers of payment cards 
you use. 
- We may share your personal information with external entities if you form part of an audience list to 
enable these entities to directly market their products or services to you.
- To governmental, judicial, regulatory and law enforcement bodies and agencies, including any credit 
regulator. 

## Sometimes we must send your personal information to other countries. 
Some of these service providers may be in other countries that may not have the same levels of protection 
of personal information as South Africa. If this is the case, we will ensure that anyone to whom we transfer 
personal information is subject to a law or binding agreement which provides an adequate level of protection,
and the third party agrees to treat that personal information with the same level of protection as we are 
obliged under the data privacy legislation.

Protecting your privacy is as important to us as it is to you. For us, it is more than just making sure we comply with  the  relevant  legislation;  you  trust  us  with  your  personal  information,  and  we  respect  that  trust.  This  Privacy Statement explains why and how we collect, use, and store your personal information. The processing of    personal information  must  be  transparent  and  secure,  in  conformity  with  the privacy  legislation  of  the  countries in which Shoprite Group operates including the Protection of Personal Information Act 4 of 2013 (POPIA).  This Privacy Statement contains the information required by POPIA and other relevant data privacy legislation.


For  purposes  of  this  Privacy  Statement,  the  term  "data  privacy  legislation"  means  all  law  relating  to  data  protection and privacy or of similar purposes or effect as amended, updated, re-enacted, or replaced from time to time including, but not limited to, POPIA. Furthermore, any term which refers to a POPIA concept or process (for example, personal information, data subject, operator, or responsible party) shall be deemed to include  a  reference  to  the  equivalent  concept  or  process  in  any  other  jurisdiction  in  which  this  Privacy  Statement may apply.

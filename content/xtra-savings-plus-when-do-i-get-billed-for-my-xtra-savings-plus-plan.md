# When do I get billed for my Xtra Savings Plus plan? 

You will be billed on the first day of sign-up. Thereafter, we will charge your card on a recurring monthly basis for the term of the membership. To avoid charges for a new billing cycle, you must cancel your plan before the end of the current term. You can cancel your plan in the Sixty60 app.

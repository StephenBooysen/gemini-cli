# How do I get my OTP if I don’t have my cellphone with me?  

To obtain your OTP (One-Time Password), you will need to have your cell phone with you. The OTP is sent to your registered mobile number by SMS for security purposes. Without your phone, you won't be able to receive the OTP and complete the verification process. Please ensure you have your cell phone available when attempting to access your account via the website.

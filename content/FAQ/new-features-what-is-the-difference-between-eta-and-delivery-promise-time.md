**ETA:** This s our best calculation of your actual delivery time based on the orders that are before yours in the queue as well as the current delivery time. This time updates live as circumstances change.

**DELIVERY PROMISE:** We’ll try our best to achieve this promised delivery time. If we deliver more than 30min later than this time, your delivery is on us.

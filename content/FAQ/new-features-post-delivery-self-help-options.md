Here you can:

- View products that were delivered, products that were out of stock, and the backup items we selected for you.
- Rate your overall experience of our services and and adjust your tip after delivery.
- Request a credit if you’re unhappy with an item, whether it’s missing, damaged or if the quality is not up to your standard.

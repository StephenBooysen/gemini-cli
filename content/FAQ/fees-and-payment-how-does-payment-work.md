# How does payment work?  

1. Your checkout amount will be captured.​ 
2. If the final basket amount is more due to weighted items or alternatives, the difference would be captured.​ 
3. If an item is out of stock, we'll credit your Sixty60 wallet. 
4. Credit can be refunded to your bank account. 

**You only pay for the goods delivered to you.**

# How can I add or remove products from an order that I already placed? 

Note: an order can only be amended up until the time when the picker commences in-store picking. Amended orders will receive an updated promise time based on in-store capacity and customer timeslot selection. 
 
You can amend your order by following these easy steps: 

1. On the Home screen, select your order under the “Order Tracking” section. 
2. Select the “Edit/View” or “Order Details” button. Then navigate to “View Your Products” 
3. If live shopping has not yet commenced, there will be an option at the bottom to select “Edit Products”. 
4. Now update your basket by increasing or decreasing item quantities or adding additional items found through the search function. 
5. Select the “Update Order” button and follow the checkout steps. 

Should payment be unsuccessful upon the update order checkout process, we will revert back to your original order and the order will continue to picking as per your new updated timeslot.

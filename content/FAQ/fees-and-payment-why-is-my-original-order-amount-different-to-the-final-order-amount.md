# Why is my original order amount different to the final order amount?  

1. Your checkout amount is calculated based on the items you’ve ordered and gets captured.​ 
2. In some cases, the final basket amount is HIGHER due to weighted or alternative items that cost more. In these situations, the difference between the two amounts will be captured and will appear as an additional entry on your bank statement. ​ 
3. If an item is out of stock, we'll credit your Sixty60 wallet. ​ 
4. Credit can be refunded to your bank account.

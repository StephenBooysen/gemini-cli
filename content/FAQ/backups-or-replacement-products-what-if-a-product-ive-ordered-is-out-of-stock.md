# What if a product Iâ€™ve ordered is out of stock?  

Your shopper will pick the backup product you selected if your first choice is out of stock. 

If you have not selected a backup, we will notify you through a push notification and give you a chance to accept our suggested replacement or select another product during shopping. If you do not respond within 3 minutes, the shopper will choose the suggested replacement.

# When and why do I need to enter a CVV?  

We understand your concern, and we want to assure you that your security remains our top priority. The decision to not require a CVV (Card Verification Value) in certain cases is part of our ongoing efforts to enhance your user experience while maintaining a secure environment.​ We also have the option to choose not to be prompted to enter a CVV for future orders.  

Here's why:​ 

**Streamlined Checkout:** We aim to make your shopping experience as convenient as possible. Removing the CVV requirement in specific instances can contribute to an easier checkout process.​ 

**Secure Partnerships:** We work with trusted payment processors (as well as with your bank) and adhere to industry best practices to ensure the highest level of security in all transactions.​ 

**Enhanced Security Measures:** Rest assured, even without the CVV, we employ advanced security measures such as encryption and other fraud prevention tools to safeguard your financial information.​ 

​If you have any specific concerns or would like more information about the security measures in place, please feel free to reach out to our support team. We value your trust, and we're committed to providing a secure and user-friendly experience.​

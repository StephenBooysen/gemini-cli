# Choosing backup products

We recommend **selecting a backup** for **each product** in your basket. We’ll **remember** these backups for future orders, **so you only need to do this once.** This way, you’ll always be in control of what you receive. 

Upon checkout, you wil be asked to review your backups:

Simply tap “Choose Backup” and select your preferred backup.

If you do not want backup for this product, tap “I Don’t Want a Backup” :

It’s that easy!

If you don’t select a backup or choose “no backup: , we’ll choose on your behalf.

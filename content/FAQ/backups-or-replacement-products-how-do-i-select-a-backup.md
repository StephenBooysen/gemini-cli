# How do I select a backup/alternative?  

We recommend selecting a backup for each product in your basket. You’ll be asked to do so at checkout. 
We’ll remember these backups for future orders, which means you only need to do this once. This way, you’ll always be in control of what you receive. 

For more information on selecting backups, [watch this informative video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T38yWj0GQc0&list=PLqg2Bw6rJIEUcINzDYgxbPbAk1cTcZ_1I&index=6).

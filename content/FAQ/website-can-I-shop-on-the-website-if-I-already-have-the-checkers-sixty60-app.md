# Can I shop on the website if I already have the Checkers Sixty60 app?  

Yes, you can shop on the web even if you already have the app. Both platforms are designed to provide a seamless shopping experience, so you can choose whichever is most convenient for you. Whether you prefer browsing on your computer or using the app on your mobile device, your account and basket will stay synced across both platforms. â€‹Your orders in progress will be visible on both your app & web at the same time

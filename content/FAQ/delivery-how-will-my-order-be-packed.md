# How will my order be packed?  

Your Sixty60 order will be packaged in a brown paper bag that is 100% recyclable. 
We always endeavour to pack heavy items at the bottom and lighter items on top. 
In the event that any product is damaged due to packing you can submit an issue within 48 hours of delivery. 
 
We will gladly credit you for the value of the product.

# When do I qualify for Sixty60’s service guarantee? 

Service Guarantee only applies to 60-min grocery orders. We’ll give you back your delivery fee if:  
- We are more than 30 minutes late. 
- You received less than 80% of your post-backup items on a basket over the value of R350. If your bas-ket value is less than R350, the minimum basket size is 10 items.

# What does Unlimited Deliveries entail? 

As a member, you get unlimited grocery and Hyper deliveries on Sixty60 in a 30-day period, provided your shopping basket totals R350 or more (excluding delivery charge).  

We may at times exclude products with special delivery requirements at our discretion. For example, free delivery may not apply to very large items like fridges or other large home appliances.

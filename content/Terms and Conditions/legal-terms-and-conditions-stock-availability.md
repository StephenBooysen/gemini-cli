# 15.  Availability

15.1 All offers and products are subject to availability and while stocks last. 

15.2 Only products indicated as available on a Platform can be purchased via that same Platform. Sometimes the products that you see on the Platforms may not be available in your area, and the prices may be different, so you must add your delivery details before you start shopping, to browse the products and prices applicable to your delivery location. 

15.3 Products stocked in stores that are not indicated as available on our Platforms, do not form part of our catalogue and therefore cannot be ordered. We may occasionally run out of stock before we can update our stock availability on the Platforms. We try to keep this to a minimum, but you may choose replacement options in case we are unable to fulfil your original request.  

15.4 Some products that are available in-store are not available for sale on our Platforms, for example tobacco products. The online sale of tobacco products is prohibited in South Africa.  

15.5 Liquor products are only available for sale on our Platforms during our licensed hours, which vary depending on the location of the fulfilment store.

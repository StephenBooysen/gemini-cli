# 17.   The delivery process

17.1 Delivery times offered may vary depending on the store from which your order will be picked and distributed, and the products that you order. At the point at which you place your order, the full list of available delivery times will be shown on the relevant Platform - this is based on your delivery address, which may be different from your registration address. **Orders containing grocery products and non-grocery products may sometimes be delivered separately, in more than one batch and at different delivery times.** 

17.2 You can track the progress of your order on the relevant Platform, including the location of the driver delivering your order. The driver may call you on the mobile number that you provided when you registered on the Platform, to locate you at your delivery address. 

17.3 The driver will bring your order to the front door or gate (but not enter the building) of your chosen delivery address and electronically record the handover of the bags containing your order to the person accepting delivery, who will not be required to sign acceptance.  The driver will deliver bags containing the products that you ordered, and not individually hand over each product. You may receive additional documentation and be requested to physically sign for orders containing mobile devices and certain other electronic devices.  

17.4 Drivers will confirm the order number and the intended recipient (as provided on the order) on request, as a means of verification. A photo of the driver and the delivery vehicle registration number will be displayed on your order tracking screen on the Platform. 

17.5 The driver will conclude the order handover on an electronic device, which will monitor the driver’s location to ensure that the handover takes place at your chosen delivery address. You will receive an order delivery confirmation notification on the Platform. 

17.6 Under no circumstances will products be left unattended by the driver, even if you request it as a delivery instruction when placing the order. 

17.7 It is your responsibility to be present (or to make sure that a person authorised to accept delivery is present) for the full duration of your chosen delivery slot. If no authorised person is available to accept your order, the driver will return the order to the fulfilment store, and a credit may be passed to your Sixty60 wallet at our discretion once the products in your order are returned to the fulfilment store’s stockholding. This credit will exclude the cost of delivery, or any promotional coupons used to discount the original order (if applicable). 

17.8 Adverse weather conditions, accidents, road work, unusual traffic congestion or any other event outside of our reasonable control may result in the occasional late or cancelled delivery, but we will try to contact you as soon as we are able to and reschedule your delivery time and date. Our entire liability to you for cancelled deliveries, if we accept such liability, will be limited to crediting your Sixty60 wallet with the current price of any products not delivered, and the associated delivery charge.  

17.9 Specific delivery requirements for SIM cards: When a SIM card is delivered, you are required to personally accept delivery and to have your barcoded ID book or ID card and proof of your residential address (like a bank statement, TV license, rates or Telkom account) with you that is not older than 3 months, otherwise the delivery of the SIM card will not be able to take place.

# 16.   Delivery areas, restrictions and exclusions

16.1 We only deliver to certain areas, as offered on our Platforms. From time to time, and with no prior notice, we will update the delivery coverage areas. We always aim to expand our coverage, but we reserve the right to limit deliveries to certain areas, which are subject to change. 

16.2 We reserve the right to withdraw our delivery services to you under certain circumstances, including but not limited to: 
- dangerous delivery conditions that pose a health or safety risk for our delivery drivers or any assistants; 
- unavailability of free, suitable and legal parking space; 
- excessive distance between the vehicle offload point and the final customer handover point, including any unreasonable requirement or expectation to climb stairs or negotiate other physical obstacles; 
- repeated failed deliveries due to factors beyond the driverâ€™s control, including but not limited to: security complexes that do not allow deliveries or that struggle to reach the customer; the customer (or person nominated by the customer to receive deliveries) repeatedly not being available, or being younger than 18 for orders containing alcohol or nicotine products; the place of residence not having a doorbell or means of notifying the customer that the driver is outside; or 
- if your refunds requests are more than the average ratio, or if your behaviour on any of our Platforms are suspicious. 

16.3 Delivery staff are not authorised to deliver orders under certain circumstances, including but not limited to the delivery of orders that contain products such as liquor and nicotine products, where persons accepting delivery are either younger than 18 years old, or unable to present proof to the driver that they are at least 18 years old. The refusal of the delivery will apply to the entire order, and not only the liquor or nicotine products included in the order. In such case you will not be entitled to a refund of the delivery costs or the reissue of any promotional offer. 

16.4 We reserve the right to decline to fulfil any order, including bulk purchases of products on promotion or included in a special offer

# 8. Using the Platforms 

8.1 We will send a one-time password (“OTP”) to the mobile number that you have provided to us when you registered on a Platform. You must use the OTP to verify your profile before you order products on the Platforms. **You must not share your OTP with anyone, as you will be held responsible for all activities and transactions under your Platform profile.** This means that, irrespective of whether the use of your profile for transactions on the Platform is unauthorised or fraudulent, we will hold you liable for payment of any order placed on the Platforms under your profile. If you know or suspect that someone else is using a Platform under your profile without your permission, you must  contact our Support Centre immediately. 

8.2 If we have reason to believe that there is or was likely a breach of security or misuse of our Platforms, we  may suspend or delete your account without prior notice.

# 11.  Payment and Sixty60 wallet credit

11.1 You must pay for the products ordered during checkout. Once the order is finalised at the fulfilment store, the final value of the products may vary from the paid amount. Total payment required is for the actual invoiced amount before the products will be delivered. 

11.2 If your final invoiced value is less than the original payment, we will automatically credit your Sixty60 wallet with the difference. 

11.3 If the final invoiced amount is higher than originally paid, we will deduct the difference from the authorised payment type supplied by you when completing your order. 

11.4 You will be charged the exact cost of your order. 

11.5 By submitting your order and payment card details, you warrant that you are at least 18 years old, are authorised to make payment with the payment card, and that there are sufficient funds available to pay for the order. 

11.6 We only accept the following payment methods: Visa and MasterCard credit cards; RCS network cards that have a Card Verification Value (CVV number); or pin-basedâ€¯debit cards (where the debit card is issued with an expiry date and a CVV number). 

11.7 We do not store any of your payment information. Your credit or debit card details are encrypted and transmitted directly to our secure payment gateway. 

11.8 You are entitled to cancel a payment where fraudulent use of your payment card has been made by another person not acting on your behalf. 

11.9 It is your responsibility to ensure that the expiry date of your payment card is after the requested dispatch date of your order and that your payment card has sufficient funds to cover the purchase. If the payment card has expired, or there are insufficient funds, we will be unable to take payment and fulfil your order. 

11.10 If your payment for an order fails, a message will appear on the checkout screen on the relevant Platform, advising you of the payment error. Your bank may also send you a notification advising you that your payment has failed. You may be able to add new payment details on the Platform to reattempt payment. 

11.11 We accept no liability or responsibility for any losses whatsoever, as a consequential result of a failed payment and subsequent order cancellation or delay. 

11.12 To protect your personal data and to ensure our compliance with applicable laws, our Support Centre agents are not allowed to accept alternative payment details telephonically or via any other medium. This is for your protection and to maintain the security of our service. 

11.13 **Sixty60 wallet credit:** Sixty60 wallet credit will automatically be applied to discount your next online order. Alternatively, you may request via the relevant Platform for the credit to be refunded into your bank account, which may take up to 5 (five) working days to reflect. Any unused credit in your Sixty60 wallet will be deemed forfeited and will expire 3 (three) years after the credit is passed to your Sixty60 wallet. Sixty60 wallet credit is non-interest bearing.

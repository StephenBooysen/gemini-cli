Most grocery products will be delivered in sealed, brown paper bags branded “Checkers Sixty60”, except for loose products unable to fit in our delivery bags, or bulk products which are more easily transported and delivered in their original packaging. Should the delivery bags of grocery products not be sealed, or the seals are broken when your order is delivered, you have the right not to accept the order. The driver will return the order to the fulfilment store, and a credit may be passed to your Sixty60 wallet at our discretion for the grocery products and delivery cost once the products have been returned to the store’s stockholding, after you log an issue with the grocery products via the Platform. Promotional coupons used to discount the original order (if applicable) may be re-issued at our discretion. 

When an issue is submitted on a Platform for incorrect grocery products delivered, or grocery products that are damaged, expired or missing, or, should the delivery of your order failed, a credit may be passed to your Sixty60 wallet at our discretion for the value of the affected products, as well as delivery fee if the entire order was affected and where the failed delivery was our fault.

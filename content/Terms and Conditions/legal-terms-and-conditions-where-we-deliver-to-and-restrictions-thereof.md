# 15. Where we deliver to and restrictions thereof 

The Checkers Sixty60 service is available in restricted areas as offered on our App. From time to time, and with no prior warning, we will update the delivery coverage areas. Whilst we endeavour to expand our coverage, we reserve the right to restrict deliveries in certain areas, including areas previously covered by our service. 

We also reserve the right to withdraw our services to individual customers' delivery addresses subject, but not limited, to the following: 

- dangerous delivery conditions that pose a health and safety risk for our delivery drivers and/or any assistant; 

- unavailability of free suitable and legal, parking space; 

- excessive distance between the vehicle offload point and the final customer handover point, including any unreasonable requirement or expectation to climb stairs or negotiate other physical obstacles; 

- repeated failed deliveries due to factors beyond the driver's control, which may include but is not limited to: security complexes that do not allow deliveries or that struggle to reach the customer; the customer (or person nominated by the customer to receive deliveries) repeatedly not being available, or being younger than 18 for orders containing alcohol or tobacco; the place of residence not having a doorbell or means of notifying the customer that the driver is outside, etc. 

 
We cannot accept responsibility for the provision of an incorrect delivery address. We will deliver to the address provided at the point of order submission. This delivery address is clearly displayed throughout the online shopping experience and can easily be changed at any point up until final payment confirmation.

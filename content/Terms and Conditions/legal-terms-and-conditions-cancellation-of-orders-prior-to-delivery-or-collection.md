# 13.   Cancellation of orders before delivery or collection

If you want to cancel your order, you must do so via the Platform where you placed your order before the cut-off time for the respective order, which is when the finalisation of the order at the fulfilment store has started. Cancellations after the cut-off time must be done by rejecting the order when the driver delivers it. A credit may be passed to your Sixty60 wallet when the products in your order have been returned to our storeâ€™s stockholding, however the delivery fee and any promotional coupons (where relevant) will not be credited to you.

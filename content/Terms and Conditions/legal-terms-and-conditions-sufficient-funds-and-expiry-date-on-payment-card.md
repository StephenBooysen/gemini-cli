# 28. Sufficient funds and expiry date on payment card 

It is your responsibility to ensure that the expiry date of your payment card is after the requested dispatch date of your order and that your payment card has sufficient funds to cover the purchase. If the payment card has expired, or there are insufficient funds, we will be unable to take payment and fulfil your order.

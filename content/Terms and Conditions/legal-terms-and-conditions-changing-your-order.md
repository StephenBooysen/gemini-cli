# 12.   Changing your order

If you want to change your order, you must do so via the Platform where you placed your order, before the cut-off time for the respective order, which is when the finalisation of the order at the fulfilment store has commenced. If the order amount is higher, another authorisation is requested from your bank to hold the revised order amount as per these terms and conditions.

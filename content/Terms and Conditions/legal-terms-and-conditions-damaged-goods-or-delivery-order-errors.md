# 20. Missing, incorrect or damaged products at the point of delivery
20.1 **Grocery products:** If, at point of delivery, you become aware of missing, incorrect or damaged grocery products (e.g. leaking contents visible through the bag, or damaged packaging visible through a tear in the bag), you have the right to refuse to accept the order. The driver will return the order to the fulfilment store, and a credit may be passed to your Sixty60 wallet at our discretion once the products have been returned to the store’s stockholding. Any promotional coupons used to discount the original order (if applicable) may be re-issued at our discretion. Alternatively, you may accept the order and log an issue via the relevant Platform for the incorrect, missing or damaged grocery products within 48 hours of delivery, which may result in a credit being passed to your Sixty60 wallet.  

20.2 Non-grocery products: If, at point of delivery, you become aware of missing, incorrect or damaged liquor, nicotine or non-grocery products, the rules under the “Returns and refunds” clause apply. 

20.3 We pride ourselves on the quality and accuracy of our delivery service. Accordingly, we monitor and investigate each customer’s claims history. 

20.4 We reserve the right in our sole and absolute discretion to block your account or restrict your ability to log an issue via the Platform temporarily or indefinitely, should we determine in our sole discretion that your claims/complaint history is more than the normal ratio.

# 30. Checkers Sixty60 Account Credit 

Where an order has been finalised and the final value is less than the original payment, Checkers Sixty60 will automatically credit your Sixty60 account with the balance. Further, when an issue is submitted on the App for products that are damaged, expired, missing or unwanted, or should the delivery of your order have failed, a credit will be passed to your Checkers Sixty60 account for the value of these products, as well as delivery fee if the entire order was affected and where the failed delivery was the fault of Checkers Sixty60. 

This credit will automatically be applied to discount your next online order.  

Alternatively, the user can request on the App for the credit to be refunded into their bank account, which will take between 3 (three) to 5 (Five) working days to reflect. If the user does not place an order or request a refund within 3 (three) years of Checkers Sixty60 account credit being passed by Checkers Sixty60, then the credit will be forfeited. Kindly note that the Checkers Sixty60 account credit is non-interest bearing. 

Product issues must be submitted on the app within 48 (forty-eight) hours after delivery has taken place. Thereafter, products can only be returned to your nearest Checkers store for a refund or replacement. To avoid disappointment, please present your tax invoice as proof of purchase when discussing the return with a member of staff at our store, either in electronic or hard copy format. 

Checkers Sixty60 reserves the right to suspend a user from the Checkers Sixty60 service should there be evidence of abuse of the credit request process.

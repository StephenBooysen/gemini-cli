# 27. General payment provisions 

Checkers Sixty60 will require payment for the value of the goods ordered during checkout. Once the order has been finalised at the fulfilment store, the final value of the goods may vary from the paid amount. Total payment required is for the actual invoiced amount prior to delivery. 

Where your final invoiced value is less than the original payment, Chedckers Sixty60 will automatically credit your Sixty60 account with the difference. 

Where the final invoiced amount is higher than originally paid, Checkers Sixty60 will deduct the difference from the authorised payment type supplied by you when completing your order. 

You will be charged the exact cost of your order. 

By submitting your order and payment card details, you warrant that you are over the age of 18 (eighteen), are authorised to make payment with the payment card, and that there are sufficient funds available to pay for the order. 

Only the following payment methods are accepted: 

- Visa or MasterCard credit Cards 

- Pin-based Debit Cards (where the Debit Card is issued with an expiry date and a CVV number.) 

For the record, Checkers Sixty60 does not store any of your payment information. Your credit or debit card details are encrypted and transmitted directly to our secure payment gateway. 

You are entitled to cancel a payment where fraudulent use of your payment card has been made by another person not acting on your behalf.

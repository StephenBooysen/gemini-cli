# 10. Order confirmation and acceptance

10.1 Your order is confirmed on completion of the checkout process, which includes us receiving electronic confirmation from your bank that the order amount has been authorised. 

10.2 The final order amount may be higher or lower than the order value at order placement, due to: 
- Replacement products priced higher or lower than the products you ordered, should these be out of stock, 
- Products priced per kilogram, where the actual weight of the product selected by the fulfilment store may differ with the estimated weight of the product as displayed on the Platforms. 

10.3 **Choosing replacement products during the ordering process:** 

10.3.1 We try our best to ensure that our stock availability displayed on our Platforms is as accurate as possible, but from time to time we are unable to locate stock of a product that has been requested, so we offer the following options during the ordering process on the Platforms: 

- you may choose not to receive a replacement and you accept that we will not provide one; or 
- you may request a specific replacement from the replacement list provided per product, or by browsing our full catalogue to find a suitable replacement. 

10.3.2 We will apply the replacement option that you choose to your future orders. 

10.3.3 The fulfilment store will try to select a suitable replacement in the same price range of the original product ordered, subject to availability, where you have not chosen a replacement option. The price of the replacement may be or less than the price of the original product, and you will be charged the price of the replacement. Due to the subjective nature of selecting an appropriate discretionary replacement, your remedy, should you find any replacement inappropriate, is limited to returning the product to a Checkers store for a full refund or replacement. To avoid disappointment, please present an electronic or hard copy of your tax invoice as proof of purchase when discussing the return with a member of staff at our store. 

10.3.4 If you don’t want a particular replacement product that we chose for you, we will not return to deliver another preferred product to replace the unwanted one. This applies to any product, not just replacement products. 

10.3.5 If a combo deal is fully or partially out of stock, we will try our best to restore the deal by presenting suitable replacements, both during the order placement and product picking process. 

10.3.6 We will first fulfil as much of the originally requested product that is available, before providing the balance as a replacement. 

10.3.7 If the price of replacement products or the final weight of products priced per kilogram result in: 

10.3.7.1 a higher final order value than the order value that you saw when you placed your order, we will automatically deduct and request an additional payment from your bank for the difference (i.e. the increase in value) up to a limited amount before your order is finalised and dispatched for delivery.  

10.3.7.2 a decrease to your order value, or where an order is finalised and the final value is less than the original payment, we will automatically credit your Sixty60 wallet with the balance.  

10.4 Where products are ordered by weight, our fulfilment store will try to provide you with an amount as close to the requested weight as possible. The actual product weight you receive may be more or less than the weight requested, within certain tolerance levels. A replacement product will be selected in line with these Terms, if the weight of the product you ordered cannot be found within our set tolerance levels. The price charged will be based on the actual weight of the product that you received and not the requested weight. We will not re-deliver any products returned due to weight or cost differences. 

10.5 The final order amount will only be subtracted from your bank account when your order has been finalised at the fulfilment store, when the price impact of replacement products and the final weight of products priced per kilogram are known. The final order amount will be calculated as follows: 

- The value of the products ordered, 
- Less: the value of products ordered that are out of stock, 
- Plus: the value of replacement products selected, 
- Less: the requested weight and corresponding value of products ordered that are priced per kilogram, 
- Plus: the actual weight and corresponding value of products ordered that are priced per kilogram, 
- Plus: the delivery fee, 
- Less: any Sixty60 wallet credit (where applicable), 
- Less: the value of promotional coupons (where applicable). 

10.6 Combo deals will be honoured based on when the order is placed and paid for, regardless of when the order is fulfilled. 

10.7 The Platforms may be offline from time to time, which may result in advertised promotions not being triggered during checkout. There may be a pop-up informing you of this, but we will not honour or be liable for any lost promotions. 

10.8 You may request a VAT invoice on the Platforms by selecting your order located under “Orders” in your profile. The invoice will be sent to you and will include details of the products you ordered and any associated delivery information. The product pricing included in the invoice is the pricing applicable on the day that your order was placed. 

10.9 Non-acceptance of an order may be as a result of factors including but not limited to the following: 
- The product that you ordered is not available from stock in the fulfilment store; 
- We are unable to process your payment; or 
- You do not meet the eligibility criteria to order certain regulated products (including, but not limited to liquor products, electronic nicotine delivery systems (“vaping products”), or any other product that contains nicotine (“nicotine products”).

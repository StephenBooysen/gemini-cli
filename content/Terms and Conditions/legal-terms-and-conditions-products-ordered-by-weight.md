# 11. Products ordered by weight 

Where products are ordered by weight, our fulfilment store will endeavour to provide you with an amount as close to the requested weight as possible. The actual product weight you receive may exceed or be less than the weight requested, but not by more than 20% (twenty percent). A replacement product will be selected in line with section 14 of these terms and conditions, if the weight of the product you ordered cannot be found within the 20% (twenty percent) tolerance level. 

Please note that the price charged will be solely based on the actual weight of the item that you received and not the requested weight. Checkers Sixty60 will not be liable for any redelivery or remedy from products returned due to weight or cost differences within the stated tolerance of 20% (twenty percent).

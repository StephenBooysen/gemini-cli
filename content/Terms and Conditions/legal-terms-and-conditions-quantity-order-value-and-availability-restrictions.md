# 19.  Quantity, order value and availability restrictions

All orders and promotions are subject to minimum and maximum quantity and/or order value restrictions. The availability of products and promotions is always area-specific. While we do our best to make these restrictions and conditions available to you via the Platforms, we may not be able to do so because of factors beyond our control. We reserve the right not to fulfil any orders that do not adhere to these restrictions. We reserve the right to amend any restrictions at any time and without notice to you. Delivery charges, Sixty60 credits and promotional coupons shall not count towards a minimum order value.

# 29. In the event of a failed payment 

This clause applies to failed payments for credit/debit card purchases. 

If your order fails payment, a message will appear on the App's checkout screen advising you of the payment error. Your bank may also send you a notification advising you that your payment has failed. You will be allowed to add new payment details on the App to reattempt payment. 

We accept no liability or responsibility for any losses whatsoever, as a consequential result of a failed payment and subsequent order cancellation or delay. 

In order to protect your personal data and to ensure our PCI compliance, our Help Centre agents are not allowed to accept alternative payment details via telephone or any other medium. This is for your protection and to ensure our service maintains the highest standards of security.

# 14.  Risk and ownership of the products

14.1 We own the products (excluding liquor products) that you purchase via the Platforms until the products are handed over to you during delivery. You become the owner of liquor products that you purchase via the Platforms at the point when your order is confirmed, unless those liquor products are not delivered to you.  

14.2 You assume all risk in the damage, disappearance or theft of products after delivery. 

14.3 We cannot be held responsible for orders placed incorrectly on our Platforms, even if the error was in good faith. If you realise during the delivery process that you have made a mistake when you placed your order, you must follow our general returns process described in these Terms. We will not be responsible for delivering the originally intended product, and you will have to place a new order, subject to a further delivery charge.

21.1 Due the quality of certain product images (as provided by third parties), product packaging redesign and improvements, the images may not always reflect exactly the product or pack you receive. Donâ€™t use product images to determine size or volume, rather refer to the description and any other available additional information on the Platform product page.

However, this information is gathered from various third-party sources and therefore we accept no responsibility and make no representation, nor give any warranty or undertaking, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any information provided on our Platforms.

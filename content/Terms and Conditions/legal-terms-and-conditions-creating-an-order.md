# 9. Placing an order

9.1 Orders can only be placed via the Platforms and not via any other medium. Our Support Centre may explain the process of placing an order, but is unable to place the order for you. 

9.2 You must indicate your delivery address before placing an order on any Platform. If your delivery address does not fall within an area currently serviced by us, you will be able to provide us with your email address and be notified when your delivery address in future falls within a serviced area. We may at any time suspend or terminate the availability of this service in your area, or products on the Platforms, at our sole discretion. â€¯ 

9.3 The final step in placing your order will be by confirming the accuracy of your basket, your replacement preferences and your chosen payment method. 

9.4 You must have a valid TV licence in order to purchase a television.

# What are Double Personalised Offers?  

You will receive double the amount of Personalised Offers every month, depending on when you signed up for Xtra Saving Plus. Personalised offers are relevant deals based on your shopping preferences. We will always strive to ensure that we tailor offers that are relevant to you. Personalised Offers are issued every two weeks and are loaded against an Xtra Saving Plus member’s profile. To redeem your offers, simply add the item/s to your basket and swipe your Xtra Savings card in-store or shop online with Sixty60. 

Should you not receive your Personalised Offers when you sign up, a minimum of six offers will be issued to you. In the subsequent weeks, you should receive double Personalised Offers.

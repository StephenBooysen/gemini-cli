# Can I change my billing date within the following months billing cycle? 

Yes, you can make this change. 

Example below:  

- Luvo's current billing date is the 21st of March.  

- Luvo updates his billing date on 23rd March.  

- Luvo's new billing date is now the 15th  

- Luvo will be billed on the day that the change is made. The prorated charges must be based on the period 21 March to 14 April. I.e., 25 days x R3.33 = R83.25   

- Luvo will be billed again on 15 April for R99.

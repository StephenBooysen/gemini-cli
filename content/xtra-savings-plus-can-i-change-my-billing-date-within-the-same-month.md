# Can I change my billing date within the same month? 

Yes, you can change your billing date in the same month. 

Example below:  

- Luvo's current billing date is the 21st of March. On 20th March, Luvo updates his billing date to 23 March.  

- Luvo will be billed for the prorated fee on 20 March for 21 to 22 March. Approx. 2 days x R3.33 = R6.66   

- Luvo will be billed again on 23 March for R99.
